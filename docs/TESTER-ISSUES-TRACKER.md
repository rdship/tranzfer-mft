## CRITICAL (8 issues)

| # | Issue | Source Report | Status | Resolution |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|------------|
| C1 | V42 Flyway self-deadlock kills 22 services on cold boot | post-release-run | **FIXED** | `SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL__AUTO=none` + `allow_jdbc_metadata_access=false` in docker-compose. SchemaHealthIndicator validates in background. |
| C2 | Flow routing ignores filename pattern — ALL files match same flow | integration-test, edi-flow-test | **FIXED** | FlowRuleCompiler.compile() combines `criteriaMatcher AND filenameMatcher` (line 32). FlowRuleRegistryInitializer loads all active flows on startup + 30s refresh. `FLOW_RULES_ENABLED=true` in docker-compose. |
| C3 | SCREEN step NPE on empty config `{}` | edi-flow-test | **FIXED** | Added null/blank guard on step.getType() at both processStep() and processStepRef() entry points. Config map already null-safe (line 657/1637). Commit d90e657. |
| C4 | Flow execution error not persisted — status stuck PROCESSING forever | edi-flow-test, integration-test | **FIXED (partial)** | FlowExecutionRecoveryJob runs every 5 min, marks stuck PROCESSING > 5 min as FAILED. But root cause (exception not caught in step loop) may still exist. |
| C5 | Virtual filesystem write failure — SFTP put to VIRTUAL accounts returns "Operation unsupported" | playwright-enterprise | **FIXED** | getFileStore() was throwing UnsupportedOperationException — Apache MINA SSHD queries it during write. Replaced with minimal FileStore implementation. Commit d90e657. |
| C6 | SFTP home directory not auto-created for PHYSICAL accounts | playwright-enterprise | **FIXED** | AccountEventConsumer creates inbox/outbox/sent on account.created event. VIRTUAL accounts skip physical dirs. |
| C7 | 80-concurrent cliff — 8 services break at exactly 80 concurrent | stress-test, resilience-architecture | **FIXED (partial)** | Phase 2: HikariCP pools scaled (SFTP 30, FTP 25, Gateway 25). PostgreSQL max_connections 200→400. But root cause may be Docker Desktop networking or OS fd limits — needs production verification. |
| C8 | config-service query performance 20x slower than onboarding-api | performance-report, stress-test | **FIXED** | Cache switched from Caffeine (per-instance, 500 cap, 30s TTL = thrashing at 100 concurrent) to Redis (shared across pods). JOIN FETCH already in repository. Commit 9fb7f4d. |

## HIGH (18 issues)

| # | Issue | Source Report | Status | Resolution |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|------------|
| H1 | demo-onboard.sh pagination bug — only 12/28 servers fetched | post-release-run | **FIXED** | Already fixed in earlier commit: `?size=1000` param added (BUG-C fix R28). |
| H2 | demo-onboard.sh counter lies — logs say 200 flows, DB has 26 | post-release-run | **FIXED** | BUG-D fix already in script: reports real DB count alongside loop counter. Counter must pre-increment for unique naming. |
| H3 | 22-service cascade when Flyway fails | post-release-run | **FIXED** | `SPRING_FLYWAY_ENABLED=false` in common-env. Only db-migrate service runs Flyway. Services boot without waiting for migration. |
| H4 | 4 nginx frontend healthchecks fail (hit proxied `/` instead of `/health`) | post-release-run | **FIXED** | Healthchecks now hit /nginx-health (static 200). Added /nginx-health to partner-portal Dockerfile. Commit f762c4a. |
| H5 | Flow deactivation API returns 400 | integration-test | **FIXED** | Added PATCH /api/flows/{id} for partial updates. Accepts any subset of fields (active, name, description, priority, direction, filenamePattern). Commit 9fb7f4d. |
| H6 | Account creation API fails — home directory on wrong filesystem | integration-test | **FIXED** | SftpFileSystemFactory now calls Files.createDirectories(homeDir) before chroot — creates dir on first login even if RabbitMQ event was missed. |
| H7 | Seed account SFTP login fails — invalid credentials despite correct bcrypt | integration-test | **FIXED** | CredentialService cache now has 60s TTL. Stale entries auto-expire. Commit f762c4a. |
| H8 | Routing engine priority semantics unclear — DB changes don't take effect | integration-test | **FIXED** | FlowRuleRegistry hot-reload via RabbitMQ + Fabric events. Phase 1 added flowCache sync on hot-reload. 30s periodic refresh as safety net. |
| H9 | User CRUD flaky — all create/update/delete fail first attempt, pass on retry | playwright-enterprise | **FIXED** | TOCTOU race on email uniqueness. saveAndFlush + ResponseStatusException(409 CONFLICT) instead of 500. Commit f762c4a. |
| H10 | Account lockout after failed attempts — no admin unlock API | playwright-enterprise | **FIXED-CTO** | CTO added BruteForceProtection.unlock(email) + POST /api/auth/admin/unlock/{email} endpoint. |
| H11 | XSS not sanitized on storage displayName | playwright-enterprise | **FIXED-CTO** | CTO added InputSanitizer.stripHtml() utility. |
| H12 | No unique constraint on partner company name — duplicates allowed | playwright-enterprise | **FIXED-CTO** | CTO added V58__partner_unique_company_name.sql + unique=true on Partner.companyName. |
| H13 | Empty body POST returns 500 instead of 400 | playwright-enterprise | **FIXED-CTO** | CTO added HttpMessageNotReadableException handler in PlatformExceptionHandler → returns 400. |
| H14 | Invalid enum values return 500 — deserialization errors unhandled | playwright-enterprise | **FIXED** | Already handled by CTO's PlatformExceptionHandler — HttpMessageNotReadableException returns 400 with clear message. Verified in code. |
| H15 | 8 API endpoints returning 500 at rest | bug-audit | **PARTIAL** | 2/8 fixed: /api/fabric/checkpoints (endpoint added), /api/encrypt/status (endpoint added). 6 remain: /api/dlq (RabbitMQ bean issue), /api/compliance (missing table?), /status (tunnel client), /api/v1/licenses (service init), /api/v1/analytics/dashboard (schema), /api/v1/screening/stats (quarantine table). Commit d90e657. |
| H16 | Alertmanager SMTP not configured — platform flying blind | bug-audit | **PARTIAL** | Webhook URLs fixed (localhost→notification-service:8097). SMTP credentials still placeholder — need real values per deployment. Commit f762c4a. |
| H17 | Missing DB column p95latency_ms — generates hundreds of errors/min | bug-audit | **FALSE POSITIVE** | Column exists in V1 baseline migration (line 374). Errors were from DB that hadn't run migrations. |
| H18 | 4 file transfers stuck on missing encryption keys | bug-audit | **FALSE POSITIVE** | demo-onboard.sh STEP 7 creates pgp-partner-1..4 + aes-key-1..4 which match all flow references. Stuck transfers were from pre-seed state. |

---

## MEDIUM (12 issues)

| # | Issue | Source Report | Status | Resolution |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|------------|
| M1 | demo-onboard.sh Step 25 skipped with bad numbering | post-release-run | **DEFERRED** | Cosmetic — step numbering in log output. Does not affect functionality. |
| M2 | nginx frontends missing TLS certificates (ui-service, partner-portal, ftp-web-ui) | tls-architecture-gap | **FIXED** | All 3 entrypoint.sh scripts now use shared /tls cert. platform_tls volume mounted. partner-portal Dockerfile has listen 8443 ssl. Commit fbc02f3. |
| M3 | Flyway schema version 999 > latest migration | bug-audit | **FALSE POSITIVE** | No V999 migration in current codebase. Was from a prior DB state. |
| M4 | PGP Key Rotation scheduler misconfigured in as2-service | bug-audit | **OPEN** | Scheduler bean not properly wired. |
| M5 | DMZ proxy receiving external scanner traffic | bug-audit | **OPEN** | Expected if exposed to internet. Add rate limiting or IP whitelist. |
| M6 | Keystore download returns wrong format (both formats return same key) | tls-architecture-gap | **FIXED** | Download endpoint now returns application/x-pem-file Content-Type with UTF-8 charset. Commit fbc02f3. |
| M7 | Keystore Redis connection uses localhost instead of redis hostname | tls-architecture-gap | **FALSE POSITIVE** | application.yml already uses `${REDIS_HOST:redis}` — correct for Docker. |
| M8 | EDI converter validate endpoint returns 415 Unsupported Media Type | edi-flow-test | **FIXED** | Added explicit consumes={APPLICATION_JSON, ALL} + null content check. |
| M9 | EDI converter accepts malformed input as valid (should return 400) | edi-flow-test | **FIXED** | X12 parser now validates ISA header (must start with ISA, >=106 chars). Validate endpoint returns 400 with parse errors. |
| M10 | EDI converter crashes on truncated X12 (returns 500) | edi-flow-test | **FIXED** | Top-level try-catch in parse() — returns EdiDocument with parseErrors instead of 500. |
| M11 | EDI converter output format may be no-op (JSON/XML/CSV/YAML identical) | edi-flow-test | **FALSE POSITIVE** | UniversalConverter.convert() correctly dispatches by targetFormat (toJson/toXml/toCsv). |
| M12 | ServerInstance → ServerConfig entity rename breaks demo-onboard.sh | cto-release-validation | **FIXED** | demo-onboard.sh updated: instanceId→name, protocol→serviceType, host/port format, 3DES���AES192. Commit 0940e9c. |

---

## PERFORMANCE (5 issues)

| # | Issue | Source Report | Status | Resolution |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|------------|
| P1 | Cold boot 12-15 minutes | performance-report, startup-optimization | **FIXED (partial)** | `allow_jdbc_metadata_access=false` + `ddl-auto=none` eliminates Hibernate validation. lazy-init=true. Full 6x improvement needs entity modularization (startup-optimization.md roadmap). |
| P2 | Per-service startup 195-260 seconds | startup-optimization | **FIXED (partial)** | Same as P1. Target <40s requires modularizing shared-platform entities into per-service subsets. |
| P3 | config-service 5.4x latency degradation under load | stress-test | **FIXED** | Same as C8 — Caffeine→Redis cache switch. Commit 9fb7f4d. |
| P4 | Memory 17.6 GB for 41 containers (77% of host) | performance-report | **FIXED** | license-service + keystore-manager reduced 384m→256m (saves 256m). edi-converter already had custom heap. Commit f762c4a. |
| P5 | 5-10s GC pauses under load | stress-test | **MONITORED** | ZGC Generational active (`-XX:+UseZGC -XX:+ZGenerational`). Further tuning needs production profiling data. |

## BREAKING CHANGES FROM CTO RELEASE (3 items)

| # | Issue | Source Report | Status | Resolution |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|------------|
| B1 | ServerInstance → ServerConfig entity rename | cto-release-validation | **FIXED** | demo-onboard.sh updated. Commit 0940e9c. |
| B2 | AS2 3DES encryption blocked (AES only) | cto-release-validation | **FIXED** | demo-onboard.sh: 3DES→AES192. Commit 0940e9c. |
| B3 | V61 materialized view missing destination_account_id column | cto-release-validation | **FIXED** | V60 migration adds column + index. V61 creates view successfully. |

## PLAYWRIGHT ENTERPRISE TEST SUITE (355 tests)

| Category | Result | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Total tests | 355 | 14 test files |
| Pass (Run 3) | 210 | Improving each run |
| Flaky | 21 | All UI timing (JWT expiry + React lazy-load) |
| Hard failures | 0 | Zero API failures |
| Run time | 13m 12s | Stable |

**Flaky root causes (all 21):**
1. JWT token expiry (15-min TTL, test suite runs 13 min)
2. React lazy-load race (first page visit fetches JS chunk)
3. Cold cache (empty tables on first assertion)

**Flaky fixes needed:**
- Increase JWT TTL to 60 min for admin sessions
- Pre-warm React chunks in Playwright setup
- Run seed data before test suite
- Use Playwright storageState auth instead of per-test login

---

| File transfer progress tracking (real-time %) | MEDIUM | SSE stream exists but no per-file % |
| Per-flow retry policy configuration | MEDIUM | Currently hardcoded 3 retries |
| Transfer scheduling (specific time) | MEDIUM | No scheduler UI or API |
| File integrity dashboard (aggregate rates) | LOW | Activity Monitor has per-file, not aggregate |
| Partner self-service onboarding | LOW | Portal exists but limited |

## NEW ISSUES (2026-04-13 Evening Session)

| # | Issue | Severity | Status | Details |
|---|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| N13 | **All services show "offline" on Dashboard — health checks use direct localhost:PORT URLs that don't work in Docker** | CRITICAL | **FIXED** | ServiceContext.jsx uses relative gateway-routed paths (`/api/pipeline/health`, `/api/servers?size=1`, etc.) with authenticated onboardingApi client. Comment at line 19: "N13 fix: Health checks routed through API gateway." |
| N0 | **UI audit: Vite chunk splitting + Gateway/DMZ redirect fix** | INFO | **FIXED** | vite.config.js manualChunks + safeLazy() wraps lazy imports. 401 interceptor now only redirects for `/api/auth/` URLs. Gateway/DMZ pages no longer redirect to login. |
| N1 | **Activity Monitor crashes when empty** | CRITICAL | **FIXED** | 3-tier empty state: "No transfers match your filters" (with clear button), "No transfers yet — Upload a file via SFTP" (zero records), generic fallback. Lines 1590-1629 in ActivityMonitor.jsx. |
| N2 | **Gateway and DMZ Proxy pages redirect to login** | HIGH | **FIXED** | 3 root causes fixed: (1) gateway @PreAuthorize changed to hasAnyRole('INTERNAL','ADMIN'), (2) DMZ JWT_SECRET aligned, (3) 401 interceptor only redirects for `/api/auth/` URLs. |
| N3 | **Flows modal ignores Escape key** | MEDIUM | **FIXED** | Modal.jsx useEffect keydown handler: closes on Escape + backdrop click. |
| N4 | **Redis @Cacheable poisons live-stats** | CRITICAL | **FIXED** | @Cacheable moved to Map data (not ResponseEntity). No ResponseEntity in cache. |
| N5 | **`/api/pipeline/health` returns 500** | HIGH | **FIXED** | PipelineHealthController exists in shared-platform. Lazy-init permanently removed — bean loads eagerly. |
| N6 | **`/api/compliance` returns 500** | HIGH | **FIXED** | ComplianceController added to config-service with profiles, violations, and server assignment endpoints. |
| N7 | **RabbitMQ definitions.json needs vhost declaration** — without `"vhosts": [{"name": "/"}]` RabbitMQ crashes on startup | CRITICAL | **FIXED** | Original definitions.json only had exchanges. RabbitMQ requires vhost to exist before importing. Fixed in commit b8c8cb4. |
| N8 | **CORS not configured for HTTPS** | HIGH | **FIXED** | CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in docker-compose includes `https://localhost` and `https://localhost:443`. SecurityConfig injects cors.allowed-origins. |
| N9 | **Auth rate limiter is in-memory, survives restart, no admin reset** — 20 req/min per IP locks out entire platform | CRITICAL | **OPEN** | CTO improved the limiter but it's still in-memory. Needs Redis backing, per-user (not per-IP) limits, admin reset endpoint, and higher threshold (100/min). |
| N10 | **File upload → routing pipeline disconnected** | CRITICAL | **FIXED** | Lazy-init permanently removed from all config files (docker-compose, k8s, demo). RabbitMQ queues declared eagerly on boot. |
| N11 | **10 of 16 Java services boot in 170-200s** | HIGH | **PARTIAL** | Entity subpackages created (core/transfer/vfs/security/integration). Hibernate fast-boot flags active. @EntityScan still scans root package recursively (all 63 entities). Further selective scan deferred — requires moving remaining 15 root entities to subpackages. |
| N12 | **V58-V63 migrations not in db-migrate container** | HIGH | **FIXED** | V58-V63 are in shared-platform JAR (`shared/shared-platform/src/main/resources/db/migration/`). db-migrate uses onboarding-api which includes shared-platform on classpath. Flyway picks them up automatically. Service-specific V64-V68 are in individual services (run when those services have Flyway enabled). |

---

### Remaining open items:

1. **N9** — Auth rate limiter in-memory (ConcurrentHashMap, not Redis-backed). Works for single-instance, won't survive restart or scale.
2. **N11** — Boot time still 170-200s for some services. Entity subpackages created but @EntityScan still scans all 63. Needs remaining 15 root entities moved to subpackages + selective scan.
3. **H15** — 6/8 API endpoints still return 500 (dlq, compliance enforcement wiring, tunnel status, license init, analytics schema, screening stats).
4. **M4** — PGP key rotation scheduler not wired in as2-service.
5. **M5** — DMZ proxy rate limiting for external scanner traffic.

| N14 | **Removing lazy-init causes Kafka to block ALL service boots** | CRITICAL | **FIXED** | Kafka 5s timeouts added to JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: `request.timeout.ms=5000`, `default.api.timeout.ms=5000`, `reconnect.backoff.max.ms=5000`. Kafka tries, times out in 5s, reconnects in background. |

| N15 | **Hibernate fast-boot flags missing from JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS** | CRITICAL | **FIXED** | All 3 flags restored: `ddl-auto=none`, `allow_jdbc_metadata_access=false`, `use_jdbc_metadata_defaults=false`. Set 3 ways: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS + shared env vars + all 17 application.yml files. Commit 3147602. |
| N16 | **RabbitMQ AUTH_REFUSED** | HIGH | **FIXED** | Removed `load_definitions` from RABBITMQ_SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS. RabbitMQ uses default guest/guest. `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=guest` + `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=guest` set in docker-compose. Services declare exchanges themselves on boot. Commit 3147602. |
| N17 | **demo-onboard.sh stuck on server creation** | HIGH | **FIXED** | Seed script updated in commit 0940e9c: instanceId→name, protocol→serviceType, host/port format, 3DES→AES192. |

```

Every external dependency has a timeout: PostgreSQL (HikariCP lazy), Redis (3s), RabbitMQ (3s), Kafka (5s).
No service can block boot on any infrastructure dependency.

| N18 | **Post-HikariPool freeze after entity restructure** | CRITICAL | **FIXED** | Root cause: `RedisServiceRegistry.register()` @PostConstruct did blocking Redis SET with NO try-catch — if Redis slow, main thread hangs. Fixed: try-catch added. Also: Redis timeout 3s, HikariCP `initializationFailTimeout=-1`, 3 double-underscore env vars fixed (MAXIMUMPOOLSIZE, MINIMUMIDLE, BOOTSTRAPSERVERS), lazy-init purged from k8s + demo compose. |

### N18 — Root Cause Analysis

Tester log showed freeze AFTER HikariPool. Investigation found `RedisServiceRegistry.register()` did blocking Redis SET in `@PostConstruct` with NO try-catch. When 17 services hit Redis simultaneously during boot, connection establishment could hang. Fix: try-catch added + Redis 3s timeout globally. Full audit verified ALL `@PostConstruct` and `@EventListener` beans now have error handling.

| N19 | **Docker healthcheck timeout too short** | CRITICAL | **FIXED** | Tester increased start_period from 90s to 240s in commit 9ddb14c. |

| N20 | **ALL services fail: SchemaHealthController requires SchemaHealthIndicator bean not found** | CRITICAL | **FIXED** | Root cause: `@ConditionalOnBean` on `@Component` classes has unreliable evaluation order in Spring Boot — conditions evaluate before target beans are registered during component scanning. Fixed: removed `@ConditionalOnBean` from both classes, `SchemaHealthController` now uses `@Autowired(required = false)` for optional injection with null-safe methods. Also fixed same pattern on `PartnerCacheEvictionListener`. |

| N21 | **Services freeze — Dockerfiles don't run Maven, need pre-built JARs** | CRITICAL | **FIXED in R32** | Root cause: ALL Dockerfiles do `COPY target/*.jar app.jar` — they don't run Maven inside Docker. `docker compose build` copies whatever JAR exists in `target/`. If `mvn clean package` wasn't run after pulling new code, Docker gets stale JARs. **Correct build sequence: `git pull && mvn clean package -DskipTests && docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up`**. `mvn clean` is critical — deletes old SNAPSHOT JARs so only R32 JARs exist in target/. |

### N21 — Full Evidence From Service Logs

**Pattern:** Every DB service follows the same timeline then freezes:
```
+0:00   Starting XxxApplication using Java 25.0.2
+1:20   HHH90000025: PostgreSQLDialect warning (Hibernate started)
+3:00   SEDA stages started (for routing services)
+3:15   [FlowFabricBridge] Initialized (Kafka connected)
+3:30   Xxx-Pool - Start completed (HikariPool ready)
+3:30   ← FROZEN — no more log output. Never reaches "Started XxxApplication"
```

**Affected services (16/22 — all with DB):**
- onboarding-api: frozen at "Onboarding-Pool - Start completed"
- config-service: frozen at "Config-Pool - Start completed"
- sftp-service: frozen at "SFTP-Pool - Start completed"
- ftp-service: frozen at "FTP-Pool - Start completed"
- ftp-web-service: frozen at "FTPWeb-Pool - Start completed"
- gateway-service: frozen at "Gateway-Pool - Start completed"
- encryption-service: frozen at "Encryption-Pool - Start completed"
- analytics-service: frozen at "Analytics-Pool - Start completed"
- ai-engine: frozen at "AIEngine-Pool - Start completed"
- screening-service: frozen at "Screening-Pool - Start completed"
- keystore-manager: frozen at "Keystore-Pool - Start completed" (then VFS init, still frozen)
- license-service: frozen at "License-Pool - Start completed" (then VFS init, still frozen)
- storage-manager: frozen at "Storage-Pool - Start completed"
- forwarder-service: frozen at "Forwarder-Pool - Start completed"
- platform-sentinel: frozen (was crashing on SchemaHealthIndicator, now freezes like others)
- notification-service: frozen (same)
- as2-service: frozen at HikariPool

**Not affected (2/22 — no DB):**
- dmz-proxy: boots in 42s
- edi-converter: boots in 42s

**What happens after HikariPool:**
Spring Data JPA initializes repository proxies for all 63 entities. With entities in the original flat package (`com.filetransfer.shared.entity.*`), this takes ~20s. After the restructure to subpackages, it appears to hang indefinitely. No log output, no error, no timeout.

**The `@EntityScan` annotation on each service:**
```java
@EntityScan(basePackages = "com.filetransfer.shared.entity")
@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = "com.filetransfer.shared.repository")
```
This should recursively scan subpackages. But the hang suggests either:
1. A circular entity reference between subpackages (e.g., `transfer.FileFlow` → `core.TransferAccount` → `transfer.FolderMapping` → `core.ExternalDestination`) causing Hibernate metadata resolver to loop
2. A `@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)` on a cross-package entity pulling the entire entity graph during initialization
3. Hibernate's `allow_jdbc_metadata_access=false` flag conflicting with the new package structure — Hibernate may need metadata access to resolve cross-package entity relationships

**Diagnostic steps for CTO:**
1. Add `-Dlogging.level.org.hibernate=DEBUG -Dlogging.level.org.springframework.data=DEBUG` to JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS temporarily — this will show exactly which entity/repository Hibernate is stuck on
2. Or revert the entity restructure to the flat package as a quick unblock — all entities back in `com.filetransfer.shared.entity.*`
3. Or move entities incrementally — start with just `vfs/` package, test, then `security/`, test, etc. to find which package split causes the hang

**JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS confirmed present (not the issue):**
```
-Dspring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none ✓
-Dspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.boot.allow_jdbc_metadata_access=false ✓
-Dspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.temp.use_jdbc_metadata_defaults=false ✓
```

| N22 | **Version banner (R30) never prints — SecurityConfigValidator not component-scanned** | HIGH | **OPEN** | `SecurityConfigValidator` in `com.filetransfer.shared.security` has `@Component` + `@PostConstruct` that prints the TranzFer version banner. But no service's `@SpringBootApplication` base package includes `com.filetransfer.shared.security`. The banner doesn't print on ANY service — not dmz-proxy (booted in 27s), not edi-converter (booted in 32s), not any other. **Fix:** Add `@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.filetransfer.shared"})` to each service's main application class, or move `SecurityConfigValidator` to a package that's already scanned. |

| N23 | **R31 version banner not printing despite setBanner() in main()** | MEDIUM | **OPEN** | Every Application class has `app.setBanner(...)` but the default Spring Boot banner still shows. Custom banner text `TranzFer MFT v1.0.0-R31` not found in any service's stdout. Possible cause: the entire `main()` body is on one line which may cause compilation issues, or `spring.main.banner-mode` overrides it, or the Banner lambda output goes to a different stream. dmz-proxy and edi-converter scan only their own package so PlatformBanner @Component isn't loaded. Test: check if `spring.main.banner-mode=off` is set anywhere, or try `app.setBannerMode(Banner.Mode.CONSOLE)` explicitly. |

| N24 | **config-service fails to build — duplicate `spring.data:` key in application.yml (lines 19 and 59)** | CRITICAL | **OPEN** | `mvn clean package -DskipTests` fails on config-service with `DuplicateKeyException: found duplicate key data`. The YAML has `spring.data:` defined twice (line 19 for Redis, line 59 likely for something else). YAML doesn't allow duplicate keys at the same level. Fix: merge both `data:` blocks into one. This blocks the entire Maven build — all services after config-service are SKIPPED. Docker build works because it uses pre-built jars from a different layer, but `mvn package` from source fails. |

| N25 | **Version banner shows UNKNOWN for edi-converter and dmz-proxy — missing common-env** | MEDIUM | **OPEN** | Banner now prints but shows `TranzFer MFT vUNKNOWN — UNKNOWN [UNKNOWN]` for services that only inherit `*spiffe-env` (edi-converter, dmz-proxy). They don't inherit `*common-env` which has `PLATFORM_VERSION`. Fix: add `<<: *common-env` to these services' environment block, or move `PLATFORM_VERSION` to a separate anchor that all services use. Services with `*common-env` (like onboarding-api) correctly show `1.0.0-R32`. |

### Completed Services

| Service | Boot Time | Phase 1 (Hibernate) | Phase 2 (SEDA+Kafka+Pool) | Phase 3 (JPA Repos) |
|---------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| dmz-proxy | 39.5s | N/A (no DB) | N/A | N/A |
| edi-converter | 35.2s | N/A (no DB) | N/A | N/A |
| ftp-service | 179.0s | ~47s | ~73s | ~59s |
| forwarder-service | 184.8s | ~60s | ~75s | ~50s |
| gateway-service | 184.3s | ~55s | ~70s | ~59s |
| sftp-service | 186.4s | ~52s | ~68s | ~66s |
| notification-service | 191.3s | ~59s | ~77s | ~55s |
| config-service | 204.3s | ~75s | ~76s | ~53s |

### Boot Phase Breakdown

**Phase 1: JVM + Classpath + Hibernate entity binding (~50-75s)**
- JVM starts, Spring context initializes
- Hibernate scans 63 entities across 6 subpackages
- Binds properties, columns, collections
- No DB access (allow_jdbc_metadata_access=false)

**Phase 2: SEDA + Kafka Fabric + HikariPool (~68-77s)**
- SEDA stages start (intake=5000/64, pipeline=2000/128, delivery=5000/64)
- Kafka Fabric connects to Redpanda (5s timeout)
- HikariPool starts (< 1s once DB is ready)

**Phase 3: Spring Data JPA repositories + remaining beans (~50-66s)**
- 60+ JPA repository proxies created
- All remaining @Component/@Service beans initialized
- Actuator endpoints exposed
- Application ready

**Total: 179-204s (3-3.4 minutes) per DB service**

### Optimization Opportunities

| Optimization | Expected Savings | Effort |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Entity scan filtering per service (only scan needed entities) | Phase 1: 50s → 10s | Medium — per-service @EntityScan config |
| Repository scan filtering (only needed repos) | Phase 3: 55s → 15s | Medium — per-service @EnableJpaRepositories |
| SEDA lazy start (start stages after app ready) | Phase 2: save ~10s | Low — move to @EventListener |
| Kafka connect async (don't block main thread) | Phase 2: save ~5s | Low — already has timeout |
| AppCDS (JDK class data sharing) | Phase 1: save ~5s | Low — Docker build change |
| **Combined** | **179s → ~60s** | |

| N26 | **Per-service scan filtering too aggressive — missing cross-package beans** | CRITICAL | **OPEN** | CTO's 293-file push added per-service `@EnableJpaRepositories` + `scanBasePackages` with specific subpackages. This excluded shared beans that services depend on. onboarding-api: `SlaBreachDetector requires ConnectorDispatcher` (ConnectorDispatcher not in scanned packages). Multiple services crash with similar missing bean errors. The scan paths need to include ALL shared subpackages that contain `@Component`/`@Service` beans, not just the entity/repository subpackages. Fix: each service's `scanBasePackages` must include `com.filetransfer.shared` (the full shared package) — not selective subpackages. |

| N27 | **ROOT CAUSE: `connection-init-sql` + `auto-commit: false` creates idle-in-transaction deadlock — onboarding-api and other services freeze at HikariPool** | CRITICAL | **OPEN** | `onboarding-api/src/main/resources/application.yml` line 55: `connection-init-sql: "SET statement_timeout = '30s'"`. Combined with `auto-commit: false` (line 50), every HikariPool connection runs `SET statement_timeout` inside an implicit transaction that never commits. Connections sit in PostgreSQL as `idle in transaction` forever. When Spring Data JPA tries to initialize repositories, it needs DB connections — but all pool connections are stuck in open transactions from the init SQL. **Evidence from PostgreSQL:** 7 connections `idle in transaction` for 6-9 minutes, all showing `SET statement_timeout = '30s'` as their last query. 4 belong to onboarding-api (172.19.0.20), 3 to db-migrate (172.19.0.10). **Why some services boot and others don't:** Services with fewer entities (ftp-service, sftp-service, encryption) complete JPA repo init before the pool connections time out. Services with more entities (onboarding with 63 entities) take longer → pool connections hang → deadlock. **Fix options:** (1) Remove `connection-init-sql` entirely — set timeout at PostgreSQL role level instead. (2) Change to `auto-commit: true` in hikari config. (3) Append COMMIT: `connection-init-sql: "SET statement_timeout = '30s'; COMMIT;"`. Option 1 is safest. |

### N27 — Full PostgreSQL Evidence

```
pid | client_addr  | state               | idle_duration | query
114 | 172.19.0.10  | idle in transaction | 00:09:06      | SET statement_timeout = '30s'
115 | 172.19.0.10  | idle in transaction | 00:09:06      | SET statement_timeout = '30s'
116 | 172.19.0.10  | idle in transaction | 00:09:05      | SET statement_timeout = '30s'
257 | 172.19.0.20  | idle in transaction | 00:06:52      | SET statement_timeout = '30s'
258 | 172.19.0.20  | idle in transaction | 00:06:52      | SET statement_timeout = '30s'
259 | 172.19.0.20  | idle in transaction | 00:06:52      | SET statement_timeout = '30s'
261 | 172.19.0.20  | idle in transaction | 00:06:52      | SET statement_timeout = '30s'

172.19.0.10 = mft-db-migrate (3 connections)
172.19.0.20 = mft-onboarding-api (4 connections)

PostgreSQL: 50 total connections / 400 max — NOT connection exhaustion
Problem: idle-in-transaction connections hold implicit locks, preventing
JPA repository initialization from completing.
```

### N27 — Affected Configuration

```yaml
# onboarding-api/src/main/resources/application.yml
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      auto-commit: false                                    # line 50
      connection-init-sql: "SET statement_timeout = '30s'"  # line 55 ← THE PROBLEM
```

The `connection-init-sql` runs INSIDE the auto-commit=false transaction.
HikariPool creates minimum-idle connections on startup. Each connection:
1. Opens implicit transaction (auto-commit=false)
2. Runs `SET statement_timeout = '30s'`
3. Returns to pool in "idle in transaction" state
4. Never commits because no application code uses it yet
5. Spring Data JPA needs connections → gets ones stuck in open transactions
6. JPA init hangs waiting for usable connections → service freezes

This explains why:
- Services with `auto-commit: false` + this init SQL freeze
- Services without this config boot fine
- The freeze happens AFTER HikariPool "Start completed" (pool ready, but connections unusable)
- Only onboarding-api has this config, but db-migrate inherits the same shared-platform jar

| N28 | **Main thread deadlocked on Spring Boot Actuator MetricsRepositoryMethodInvocationListener** | CRITICAL | **OPEN** | Thread dump shows main thread `WAITING (parking)` on `ReentrantLock` at `MetricsRepositoryMethodInvocationListener.afterInvocation` → `SingletonSupplier.get()`. This is a known Spring Boot/Micrometer deadlock where JPA repository metrics initialization blocks the main thread during Spring context refresh. Affects services with many JPA repositories (onboarding-api has 60+). Services with fewer repos boot because they acquire the lock before contention. **Fix options:** (1) Disable JPA repository metrics: `management.metrics.data.repository.autotime.enabled=false` (2) Upgrade to Spring Boot 3.3+ which fixes this deadlock (3) Add `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.generate_statistics=false` to prevent the metrics listener from activating during init. |

| N29 | **Docker build fails — `Unsupported jarmode 'tools'` in ftp-service Dockerfile** | CRITICAL | **OPEN** | CTO's latest Dockerfile uses `java -Djarmode=tools -jar app.jar extract` which requires Spring Boot 3.3+. Project is on Spring Boot 3.2.3. Build fails on ftp-service, cancels all other service builds. **Fix:** Either upgrade to Spring Boot 3.3+ or revert Dockerfile to use `COPY target/*.jar app.jar` without the extract step. |

| N30 | **analytics-service crash-loops (27 restarts) — FileTransferRecordRepository not in scan path** | CRITICAL | **OPEN** | `MetricsAggregationService` requires `FileTransferRecordRepository` (moved to `repository.transfer` package). analytics-service's `@EnableJpaRepositories` doesn't include this subpackage. 15 consecutive APPLICATION FAILED TO START. Same N26 pattern — scan filtering too restrictive for this service. |
| N31 | **config/sftp/forwarder restart after successful boot (exit code 0)** | HIGH | **OPEN** | Services boot successfully (300-335s), run for a period, then exit with code 0. Docker restarts them. 8-15 restarts each. Not a crash — clean exit. Possible cause: `restart: unless-stopped` + something triggering graceful shutdown (memory pressure from RabbitMQ high watermark alarm, or a health endpoint returning DOWN after initial UP). |

| N32 | **keystore-manager and license-service missing common-env — N28 metrics deadlock still active** | CRITICAL | **OPEN** | keystore-manager and license-service have only 136 chars of JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS — they don't inherit `*common-env` from docker-compose.yml. Missing: `management.metrics.data.repository.autotime.enabled=false`, `spring.data.jpa.repositories.bootstrap-mode=lazy`, all Hibernate fast-boot flags, Kafka timeouts. keystore-manager deadlocks on `MetricsRepositoryMethodInvocationListener` (same N28) because the fix flag isn't applied. Also affects: edi-converter (104 chars), api-gateway/db-migrate/ftp-web-ui/partner-portal/ui-service (non-Java, OK). **Fix:** Add `<<: *common-env` to keystore-manager and license-service environment blocks in docker-compose.yml. |

| N33 | **SEDA pipeline disconnected — RabbitMQ serializer mismatch drops all FileUploadedEvents (DEMO BLOCKER)** | CRITICAL | **OPEN** | **ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** SFTP service `RoutingEngine` publishes `FileUploadedEvent` to RabbitMQ using **JDK serialization** (`contentType=application/x-java-serialized-object`). Config-service `FileUploadEventConsumer.onFileUploaded(FileUploadedEvent)` expects **JSON**. Spring AMQP throws `MessageConversionException: Cannot convert from [[B] to [FileUploadedEvent]` — message is **rejected and dropped** (routed to DLX or discarded). Zero messages ever reach the consumer method. **This is why `file_transfer_records` and `flow_executions` tables are always 0.** The fix is one of: (1) Configure `Jackson2JsonMessageConverter` bean in SFTP service's RabbitMQ producer (so it publishes JSON), or (2) Configure `Jackson2JsonMessageConverter` in config-service's consumer (so it can read JDK-serialized objects), or (3) Set `spring.rabbitmq.template.default-receive-queue` and configure a shared `MessageConverter` bean in shared-platform so all services use the same format. **Files:** sftp-service `RoutingEngine` (publisher), config-service `FileUploadEventConsumer` (consumer), shared-platform RabbitMQ config. **Evidence:** config-service log: `Cannot convert from [[B] to [com.filetransfer.shared.dto.FileUploadedEvent]`, `contentType=application/x-java-serialized-object`, queue=`file.upload.events`, routing-key=`file.uploaded`. |

| N34 | **SFTP FileUploadedEvent fires only ~33% of uploads** | HIGH | **OPEN** | 30+ files uploaded via `sftp` client, only 10 `FileUploadedEvent` messages in logs. The `onClose` SFTP subsystem event may not fire if the client disconnects before the server-side file handle is fully closed. Particularly affects non-interactive SFTP sessions (scripts, automated batch uploads). **Recommendation:** Emit FileUploadedEvent on write completion, not session close. |

| N35 | **SCP file uploads bypass SFTP subsystem — files never detected by RoutingEngine** | MEDIUM | **OPEN** | Files uploaded via `scp` land on disk but are invisible to the SFTP service RoutingEngine because SCP doesn't use the SFTP subsystem. Partners using SCP-mode clients (WinSCP SCP mode, OpenSSH scp) will have orphaned files. **Recommendation:** Add filesystem WatchService or polling as a fallback detection mechanism. |

| N36 | **SFTP account home directories not auto-created — AccessDeniedException on first login** | HIGH | **OPEN** | Bootstrap creates transfer_accounts with home_dir paths (e.g., `/data/partners/acme`) but these directories don't exist in the container filesystem. First SFTP login fails with `AccessDeniedException: /data/partners`. Required manual `docker exec -u root mkdir` to fix. **Recommendation:** Auto-create homeDir on account creation or first login. |

| N37 | **Config service GET /api/flows — cache poisons empty result (PARTIALLY FIXED)** | HIGH | **PARTIAL** | CTO fixed FlowStep `implements Serializable` + added `RedisCacheConfig` with JSON serializer in bdac0c5b. **Serialization now works.** But a race condition remains: if the first `getAllFlows()` call happens before Flyway seed completes (or during boot probe), it returns 0 flows and caches the empty list under key `flows::SimpleKey []`. All subsequent calls return 0 despite 21 flows in DB. `FLUSHALL` fixes it — next call returns 21. **Fix:** Add `unless = "#result.isEmpty()"` to the `@Cacheable` annotation on `getAllFlows()` in `FileFlowController`. This prevents caching empty results. |

| N38 | **Auth endpoint path mismatch — `/api/v1/auth/login` returns 403** | MEDIUM | **OPEN** | `SecurityConfig` permits `/api/auth/**` but not `/api/v1/auth/**`. The `AuthController` is mapped to `/api/auth` (no v1 prefix). Any client using `/api/v1/` prefix gets 403 from Spring Security's `anyRequest().authenticated()`. UI may reference both paths inconsistently. |

| N39 | **Bootstrap creates only 6 transfer accounts on fresh DB (was 239)** | LOW | **OPEN** | Previous builds seeded 239 accounts (100 SFTP + 100 FTP + named). Current bootstrap creates only 6 named accounts (acme-sftp, globalbank-sftp, logiflow-sftp, medtech-as2, globalbank-ftps, retailmax-ftp-web). Sanity validation accounts threshold fails. Demo has fewer accounts to work with. |

| N40 | **Activity Monitor SSE stream rejects query-param JWT token (403)** | MEDIUM | **OPEN** | `GET /api/activity-monitor/stream?token=<JWT>` returns 403. The controller method has `@PreAuthorize("permitAll()")` but Spring Security filter chain intercepts before reaching the controller. The `EventSource` browser API cannot send `Authorization` headers, so query-param is the only SSE auth path. **Fix:** Add `/api/activity-monitor/stream` to `permitAll()` in `SecurityConfig`, or add a custom filter that extracts the `token` query parameter and sets it as the auth context. |

| N41 | **Platform Sentinel shows "offline" on UI despite container being healthy** | HIGH | **OPEN** | Docker reports `mft-platform-sentinel Up (healthy)`. Sentinel runs analysis cycles successfully: `HealthScoreCalculator: overall=69, infra=10, data=100, security=85`. But UI shows "offline". The onboarding-api's health probe to sentinel:8098 likely fails due to SPIFFE inter-service auth blocking the request. **Evidence:** Sentinel logs show active analysis, but no inbound health-check requests logged. |

| N42 | **AI Engine shows "unavailable" on UI — SPIFFE auth + missing OSINT API keys** | HIGH | **OPEN** | Docker: `mft-ai-engine Up (healthy)`. AI Engine runs OSINT, CVE monitoring, threat intelligence successfully. But three sub-issues: (1) `storage-manager` returns 403 to AI Engine's `listObjects` request — SPIFFE auth blocking inter-service call. (2) Actuator `/metrics/jvm.memory.used` returns 404 — static resource handler catches it instead of actuator endpoint. (3) URLhaus/ThreatFox return 401 — OSINT API keys not configured. UI shows "unavailable" because onboarding-api's health probe to ai-engine:8091 fails. |

| N43 | **Config-service GET /api/flows/executions returns 500 — nullable param type error** | HIGH | **OPEN** | JPA `@Query` with nullable filter parameters causes PostgreSQL error: `could not determine data type of parameter $1`. The query uses `(? is null or fe.track_id = ?)` pattern which PostgreSQL cannot type-infer for null parameters. **Fix options:** (1) Use Spring Data Specification API instead of native query, (2) Cast nulls: `(CAST(? AS text) IS NULL OR ...)`, (3) Use `@Query` with JPQL and `@Param` annotations with explicit type hints. **File:** `config-service` FlowExecutionRepository — query for `findByFilters`. |

| N44 | **EDI Maps UI screen returns 404 — missing nginx gateway route** | MEDIUM | **OPEN** | UI calls `/api/v1/edi/maps` but nginx gateway has no `location /api/v1/edi/` route. Gateway has `/api/v1/convert/` → edi-converter:8095 but EDI map CRUD lives at `/api/v1/edi/`. Request falls through to default UI proxy → 404. **Fix:** Add `location /api/v1/edi/ { set $up edi-converter:8095; proxy_pass http://$up; }` to `api-gateway/nginx.conf`. Also check if AI Engine's `/api/v1/edi/training/` needs a separate route to ai-engine:8091. |

| N45 | **Licenses UI screen returns 400 — requires X-Admin-Key header** | MEDIUM | **OPEN** | `LicenseController` requires `@RequestHeader("X-Admin-Key")`. UI sends `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` but not the admin key. Returns 400 "Required header 'X-Admin-Key' is missing". **Fix:** Either UI sends `X-Admin-Key` from config, or LicenseController accepts JWT auth (check role=ADMIN) as alternative to admin key header. |

| N46 | **Config Export UI returns 405 — endpoint is POST only** | LOW | **OPEN** | `ConfigExportController` only has `@PostMapping` for `/api/v1/config-export`. UI likely sends GET to load/download the export. Returns 405 "Method Not Allowed". **Fix:** Add `@GetMapping` for export download or change UI to POST with export parameters. |
